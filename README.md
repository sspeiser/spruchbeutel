# Spruchbeutel

Displays a bag and when you click on it, it display a random quote using typed.js.

Also has a mode for displaying all quotes.

Just add a src/config.ts with your custom labels and quotes (see src/config.ts.example), run npm run build and copy the contents of "dist" into the folder "spruchbeutel/" of your server. You can change the folder name in package.json "build" script.

Have fun.
